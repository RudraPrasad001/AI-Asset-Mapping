# AOI Mapper Project (FastAPI + React)

This project contains:
- `backend/` - FastAPI app that uses Google Earth Engine (Sentinel-2) to classify water, agriculture, forest, and infrastructure within a circular AOI computed from a provided area.
- `frontend/` - React app (Leaflet) that posts input JSON to the backend and visualizes returned layers.

See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for running instructions.
